#Online multiplayer game
This was a group project carried out in Week 13 of the immersive coding course at [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/). 

Our group was Bear PACK:

##Brief
We created our own brief, with the starting point that it should be a multiplayer game based around the world map. The basic idea is that: 

* a player can 'take' a country by selecting it on the map and answering quiz question(s)
* another player can 'steal' the same country from them by getting a better score
* players are ranked according to the number of countries they hold, then on their scores. 

In terms of functionality, this meant that:

* the game state needed to persist and be dynamic
* each player's game view should be continuously updated.

##Tech

* Vanilla JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express (web framework)
* MongoDB (NoSQL database)
* webpack (module bundler)
* HTML and CSS
