#Online multiplayer game
This was a group project carried out in Week 13 of the immersive coding course at [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/). 

Our group was Bear PACK:

**P**avlos MacDonald (https://github.com/godhar)

**A**lex Bazlinton (https://github.com/abazlinton)

**C**ookie Lanfear (https://github.com/clanfy)

**K**ate Manson (https://github.com/katemanson)

##Brief
We created our own brief, with the starting point that it should be a multiplayer game based around the world map. The basic idea is that: 

* a player can 'take' a country by selecting it on the map and answering quiz question(s)
* another player can 'steal' the same country from them by getting a better score
* players are ranked according to the number of countries they hold, then on their scores. 

In terms of functionality, this meant that:

* the game state needed to persist and be dynamic
* each player's game view should be continuously updated.

One constraint was that we couldn't use any big additional frameworks or libraries (other than Express to run the server), meaning we could use vanilla JavaScript only, without, for example, React or jQuery. 

##Group working
As the this was the first substantial group project we'd done on the course, we set some goals and guidelines for working together:

* Use agile methods: daily stand-ups and reviews, pair programming, maintaining a project backlog via a Trello board
* Gain experience in using Git and GitHub within a team
* Consolidate existing JavaScript skills but also explore and experiment
* Make sure everyone is thoroughly involved and up to speed. 

##Tech

* vanilla JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express (web framework)
* MongoDB (NoSQL database)
* webpack (module bundler)
* HTML and CSS
